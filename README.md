This project contains a 3D rendering of our solar system and allows a user to navigate around and discover interesting facts about the various planets including planet size, gravitational factors, and orbital speeds. As well as Observe the different positions and orbits of planets relative to the sun.

* The nav bar contains links to my Github repo, and my LinkedIn.
* The instructions will appear when the project is launched telling users how to use the visualization.
* The sun remains in the center of the window as a user navigates.
* The scene contains 8 planets, as well as their orbital paths around the sun
* When a planet is selected an information box will appear displaying volume, diameter, surface gravity, rotation period, orbital period, orbital velocity, surface temperature, presence of moons, and presence of rings.
