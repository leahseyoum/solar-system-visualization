# Solar System Visualization

## Background
This project is an interactive exploration of our solar system.  In this project users will be able to traverse around our solar system and discover interesting facts about the various planets including planet size, gravitational factors, and orbital path around the sun.

## Functionality 

- navigate through a 3D rendering of the solar system using click-and-drag.
- Select individual planets to investigate further.
- Observe the different positions and orbits of planets relative to the sun.
- research topics further through the use of links to external resources.

In addition, this project with include:
- instructions on how to navigate effectively
- A production README

## Technologies, Libraries, and APIs
- three.js
- D3.js

## Implementation Timeline
- Friday: Finish setting up project, establish the general layout of the page and start working on 3D rendering with three.js.
- Weekend: Continue to work on 3D rendering  as well as the dimensions of individual planets and overall spacing.
- Monday: Work on the interactive elements of my page, particularly the click and drag functionality that will enable a user to navigate the page. Start to work on the data rendering aspects of my visualization using D3.
- Tuesday:	 Continue to work on creating  visuals for my data that are responsive to user controls.
- Wednesday: Finish setting up user controls and finish styling elements.
- Thursday: Deploy to GitHub pages, write final version of production ReadMe
